CORE TYPES

- number - 1, 5.3, -10 - all numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats
- string - "Hi", 'Hi', `Hi` - all text values 
- boolean - true, false - just these two no "truthy" and "falsy" values

- Typescript type system only helps you during development - before the code gets compiled
